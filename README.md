# Time-analysis-TCS-Stock-market
This project deals with the time analysis of stock market prices .This acts as a guide for analyzing stock market prices over a period of time

The purpose of this analysis is to identify patterns in the TCS-stock-price dataset in order to make informed investment decisions

This project involves

1.COLLECTING DATA=Collect Data: The first step is collecting dataset from kaggle and performing operations.
It is important to collect data for a significant period of time, preferably several years, in order to identify trends and patterns.

2.CLEAN DATA=Once dataset is imported then cleaning or preprocessing dataset if necessary

3.PLOT DATA=The next step is to plot the data on a graph. This will allow you to visualize the price movements over time
You can use a line graph to plot the closing prices over time or a candlestick chart to show the open, high, low, and close prices for each day.

4.IDENTIFYING TRENDS AND PATTERNS=After plotting we have identified the trends and patterns

5.TRAINING=After identifying patterns.it is found that keras library is suitable for the time analysis projects
so we have trained the models with keras and performed operations

6.ERRORS=mean squared error has been used in this project and identified any errors are present

Finally by following these steps time analysis has beeen done on the TCS-Stock-price dataset
